Minimal Production System
=========================

Introduction
------------
The Minimal Production System (MPS) started out as an experiment in Common Lisp
macrology (the idea was to convert CLIPS syntax into executable Common Lisp
code) but since things started to fall into place quite neatly. I thought maybe
it would be worth implementing a subset of CLIPS syntax and functionality.

Minimal Production System
=========================

Introduction
------------
The Minimal Production System (MPS) started out as an experiment in Common Lisp
macrology (the idea was to convert a subset of CLIPS syntax into executable
Common Lisp code) but since the | character has special meaning to the Common
Lisp reader it's difficult to implement the or-connective-constraint in
pattern-CE's. So, instead I'll focus on implementing a production system using
Common Lisp syntax instead.

There's a bit more info about the CLIPS expirement on my old blog // comments
are lies! See http://commentsarelies.blogspot.com/search/label/MPS

Current Status
--------------
Currently (2009-02-23) MPS can compile very simple rules (one CE) and execute
them. And that's about it. Not very useful, but at least it's a start.

Simplest example possible
